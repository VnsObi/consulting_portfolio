## The Build vs. Buy Dilemma

Every founder wants to own their tech stack, but few calculated the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) correctly.

### The 80/20 Rule of SaaS

If an off-the-shelf solution does 80% of what you need, **take it**. The remaining 20% is rarely worth the $500k/year engineering team required to maintain a custom fork.

**Build when:**

- The capability is your core differentiator.
- Regulatory requirements prevent standard SaaS usage.
- You have outscaled the limitations of available tools.

**Buy when:**

- It is a commodity function (Payroll, CRM, Email).
- Speed to market is the primary constraint.
